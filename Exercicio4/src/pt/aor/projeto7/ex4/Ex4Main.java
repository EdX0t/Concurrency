/*
4. Consider a multi-threaded server and the following division of work: the master thread
receives commands and the remaining worker threads execute these commands. To
simplify, the purpose of the command is to compute the square root of a real number and
print the result to the standard output (screen). You should write the program assuming
that the master thread generates numbers at random, waiting some random time between
two consecutive numbers. The master should use some form of queue to send the tasks to
the workers (e.g., the ArrayBlockingQueue). You should do a print identifying the
worker thread that is responsible for computing the result.
